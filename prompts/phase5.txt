PHASE 5: PROJECT-BASED LEARNING

> Mini-Project Scope: I want to build a simple 'Product Showcase' site to practice. Define the scope for me: It should use 1) Dynamic routes for products, 2) A layout, 3) Server-side data fetching, and 4) One interactive client component. What are the specific files I will need to create?

RESPONSE:
- app/page.js (home)
- app/products/[id]/page.js (dynamic)
- app/layout.js (root)
- app/components/AddToCart.js ('use client')
- app/data/products.js (mock data)

> Don't give me the full solution. Instead, ask me diagnostic questions to help me find the bug myself. My error is: Error: A component is trying to use a client hook inside a server component. What should I check first?

RESPONSE:
Check the file's first line. Is there 'use client';? If not, add it. If yes, check imports. Are you importing a component that might be using hooks (like useState) but is missing its own 'use client'; directive?
